# maestros - Multi-label Stratified Group Splits

`maestros` is a Python library that provides functionality for performing multi-label stratified group splits. This library is particularly useful for machine learning tasks involving multi-label data with grouped samples, where the train and test sets need to be stratified to maintain the label distribution, while ensuring the groups are disjoint. The multi-label stratification is done through the [iterative-stratification](https://github.com/trent-b/iterative-stratification) library. The included stratification chart and report can also be used for multi-label data where samples do not belong to groups.

## Features

- Perform multi-label stratified group splits, ensuring that groups are disjoint.
- Create stratification reports to analyze the distribution of labels across the complete dataset and the train and test sets.
- Visualize the stratification results using a chart.
- Features adapt when a validation set is included.
- Easy-to-use with mock data generation for testing purposes.

## Installation

Install the `maestros` package using `pip`:

```python
pip install maestros
```

## Requirements

```
iterative_stratification==0.1.7
matplotlib==3.5.3
numpy==1.22.3
pandas==1.5.1
scikit_learn==1.0.2
```

## Usage

Import the needed functions from the library.

```python
from maestros import *
```

Load your own data or do a first test with `create_mock_data`. Optionally include label names.

```python
# Create multi-label samples, each belonging to one of the 5 groups
X, y, groups = create_mock_data(n_samples=500, n_labels=5, n_features=4, n_groups=5, seed=42)

# Define the labels that should be displayed in the report and the chart
labels = ['Beach', 'Water', 'Tree', 'House', 'Mountain']
```

Perform the multilabel stratified group split (optionally done twice to create a validation set).

```
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, train_indices, test_indices = multilabel_stratified_group_split(X, y, groups, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, shuffle=True)
```

While the groups created with this tool are always disjoint, this can be checked with `check_disjoint_groups`. This can also be useful if you have created splits in other ways.

```python
check_disjoint_groups(train_indices, test_indices, groups)
```

Print a stratification report.

```
stratification_report(y, y_train, y_test, labels=labels)
```

The label distribution shows the percentage of class '1' samples of the complete, training, (validation) and test set. The difference shows how much the distribution of a set differs from that of the complete set. A mean difference closer to 0 is a better stratified set.

```
Label distribution:
Label            Complete   Train      Test  
Beach           0.789      0.787     0.795
Water           0.799      0.799     0.800
Tree            0.824      0.833     0.790
House           0.770      0.775     0.751
Mountain        0.818      0.806     0.863

Differences:
Label            Train-Complete  Test-Complete  
Beach                0.002          0.006
Water                0.000          0.001
Tree                 0.009          0.034
House                0.005          0.019
Mountain             0.012          0.045

Mean Differences:
Train-Complete: 0.005
Test-Complete: 0.021
```

Plot the stratification chart.

```
create_stratification_chart(y, y_train, y_test, labels=labels)
```

### Including Validation Set

To include a validation set, simply execute the `multilabel-stratified-group-split` twice: once to create `train_val` and `test` sets, and once to create a `train`  and `test`  set from `train_val`. For the stratification report and chart, include y_val when calling the function.

```
# First, split the data into 80% train+val and 20% test
X_train_val, X_test, y_train_val, y_test, train_val_indices, test_indices = multilabel_stratified_group_split(
    X, y, groups, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, shuffle=True
)

# Define groups of train_val
groups_train_val = groups[train_val_indices]

# Next, split the train_val data into 75% train and 25% validation (resulting in 60% train, 20% val, and 20% test)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val, train_indices, val_indices = multilabel_stratified_group_split(X_train_val, y_train_val, groups_train_val, test_size=0.25, random_state=42, shuffle=True)

# Stratification report with validation set
stratification_report(y, y_train, y_test, y_val=y_val, labels=labels)

# Stratification chart with validation set
create_stratification_chart(y, y_train, y_test, y_val=y_val, labels=labels)
```
